# Simple Counter Sample

This sample illustrates the `isFixedTimeStepWithVsync` setting. When set to false MonoGame will continuously run update and draw as fast as possible.

This can be used to create your own update loop as explained [here](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/). 

The example is the simple counter but with an fps counter. You can play with the `isFixedTimeStepWithVsync` and the console trace logging to see the effect on FPS.
